\subsection*{Abstract}

The digital storing of knowledge and data is an essential tool to work
collaborativ and globally, independant from  field. To set this data in context
and connect them semantically and also link them to other data, they are
organised in ontologies. Ontologies define the important data and who they are
linked to each other. Usually ontologies are developed for a certain discipline
or branch of study, e.g. a species or collection of books. Nevertheless there
are ontologies for broader areas. For example, the Dublin Core Metadata
Initiative, which is used for any kind of document or web ressource.\\
Besides the storing of knowledge, the methods and technologies of the Semantic
Web and ontologies are used in other areas, e.g. in Machine and Deep Learning.
On one hand to find matchings and on the other hand to store information. This
way ontologies are part of a field of study that is thriving at the moment. And
this makes room for software that can be used by technically not well-versed
people.
