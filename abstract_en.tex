\subsection*{Abstract}

Digital storage of knowledge and data is essential for collaborative and global
work between disciplines. To put data in context, connect them semantically and
link them to other data, ontologies are frequently used. Ontologies define
important data and how they are linked to each other. Typically ontologies are
developed for a certain area (eg. an animal species or a collection of books).
However, more general ontologies were created in the past years, eg. within the
Dublin Core Metadata Initiative which is used to describe any kind of document
or web resource.\\
Besides storage, methods and technologies of the SemanticWeb and ontologies are
used in other areas, e.g. in Machine and Deep Learning. On one hand to find
matchings and on the other hand ontologies are used for structured storage of
information. Since ontologies are nowadays frequently used in many different
areas the need for ontology-matching software that can be used easily by
non-informatics-experts is increasing.
